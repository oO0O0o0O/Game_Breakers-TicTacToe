This simple program is used to cheat in a game of TicTacToe by displaying the 
best moves to take. The genOptions script generates all possible games of 
TicTacToe, and tracks the win condition (first player, second player, draw) 
for each game. These games are then loaded by the gameBreaker during a game,
and the user can input live moves to be shown the next move that results
in the most possible winning outcomes.
